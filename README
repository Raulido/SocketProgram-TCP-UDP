My UDP client works by grabbing input from user then sending input to server.
I used the skeleton code from discussion section to initialize connection between
client and server. I added a while loop so my program can receive multiple messages
from server. 
My UDP server works the same way as my client does, but has some differences.
The server never closes the socket and hence is always receiving messages unless
the user uses CTRL+C. The server also has a while loop to keep retrieving messages
but also contains a simple for loop for calculating the sum of the messages retrieved.

My TCP server/client work in a similar way that the UDP server/client do, but instead
use different functions to send/retrieve/listen/etc. The TCP program is slightly different
in that it uses a total of 3 sockets to send information. The TCP program listens to establish
a 3 way connection and closes once the final answer is sent to the client. A lot of the functionality
is taken from the UDP program. Also used the skeleton code provided in discussion section to start off.
